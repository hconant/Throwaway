#Throwaway GitHub Repository

This is a place where I am learing about working with GitHub repositories.

A Markup file (.md) is a text file that uses Markup syntax to produce a document that others can read online when they check out your repository.

I hope to learn the following:

- How to make a repo
-How to publish a repo using GitHub Desktop
-How to make commits to a repo

Lets give it a go :) Also, try out [Introduction to GitHub](http://github.github.io/on-demand) to learn more.
